### Functions in the IPM kernel
For data from a pre-reproductive census, with a discrete seedling and seedbank stages 


**Distribution of size of individuals in year *t+1*:**
New recruits from the seedling stage + growth and survival kernel
$$n(z',t+1) = S(t)p_{estab}c_o(z') + \int_{L}^{U}(1-p_b(z))s(z)G(z',z)n(z,t)dz $$
**Size of the seedling stage:**
$$S(t+1) = p_r\Big[\gamma B(t) + (1-\delta)\int_{L}^{U}p_b(z)b(z)n(z,t)dz\Big] $$

**Seedbank:**  (after Ellner, 2016)
$$B(t+1) = s_{B}\Big[(1-\gamma)B(t)+\delta\int_{L}^{U}p_b(z)b(z)n(z,t)dz \Big]$$

# Load *Oenothera coloradensis* census data
```{r}
# load spatialized data, which we'll need for neighborhood calculations
load("../Processed_Data/spatial_COBP.RData")
dat <- butterfly
# dat <- read.csv("../Raw Data/COBP_long_CURRENT.csv")
```
## transform the necessary variables
```{r}
#### make log-transformed size variables ####
dat$log_LL_t <- log(dat$LongestLeaf_cm)
dat$log_LL_tplus1 <- log(dat$longestLeaf_tplus1)
dat$log_LL_tminus1 <- log(dat$longestLeaf_tminus1)

#### round seed count numbers (that were modeled based on regression) to whole numbers ####
dat$Num_capsules <- round(dat$Num_capsules, digits = 0)
```

# Calculate local neighborhood density
```{r}
# use plantTracker package
library(plantTracker)
# make a column that has 'trackID' data
dat$trackID <- paste0(dat$Plot_ID,"_",dat$ID)
dat$Species <- "OENCOL"

## calculate neighbors w/in a 10cm radius
dat_1 <- plantTracker::getNeighbors(dat = dat, buff = 10, method = "count", compType = "oneSpp", quad = "Plot_ID")
## rename column to indicate radius
names(dat_1)[6] <-"neighbors_10"

## calculate neighbors w/in a 5 cm radius
dat_2 <- plantTracker::getNeighbors(dat = dat_1, buff = 5, method = "count", compType = "oneSpp", quad = "Plot_ID")
## rename column to indicate radius
names(dat_2)[6] <-"neighbors_5"

## calculate neighbors w/in a 15 cm radius
dat_3 <- plantTracker::getNeighbors(dat = dat_2, buff = 15, method = "count", compType = "oneSpp", quad = "Plot_ID")
## rename column to indicate radius
names(dat_3)[6] <-"neighbors_15"

dat <- dat_3
```

Figure out which neighborhood radius makes the most sense, i.e. explains the most variation in growth and survival
```{r}

```


## other potential covariates from the data
Invertebrate leaf herbivory, stem herbivory, leaf spots (unknown source?)

# Make vital rate models 
### Survival 
$$s(z)$$
```{r}
## subset the data to exclude flowering individuals
survDat <- dat[dat$flowering==0 | is.na(dat$flowering),]

# ## visualize the data

## logistic glm with log-transformed size_t
survMod <- glm(survives_tplus1 ~ log_LL_t, data = survDat, family = binomial)
summary(survMod)
## plot model results 
plot(survives_tplus1 ~ log_LL_t, data = survDat)
newdata <- data.frame("log_LL_t" = seq(from = min(survDat$log_LL_t, na.rm = TRUE), 
               to = max(survDat$log_LL_t, na.rm = TRUE),

## lm w/ log-transformed size_t and size_t+1
sizeMod <- lm(log_LL_tplus1 ~ log_LL_t , data = dat)
summary(sizeMod)
## plot model results
plot(log_LL_tplus1 ~ log_LL_t, data = dat)
abline(sizeMod, col = "red")
```

### Number of seeds produced, according to plant size
$$b(z)$$
using size in current year (no. of seeds/plant, for those that flowered ~ size_t)
```{r}
 ## use only plants that flowered 
 seedDat <- dat[dat$flowering==1,]

# ## visualize the data

                                       length.out = 100))
lines(x = newdata$log_LL_t, y = predict(object = seedMod_t, newdata =  newdata, type = "response"), col = "red")
```

### Flowering probability
$$p_b(z)$$
using size in current year (w/ squared term)
```{r}
## logistic glm with log-transformed size_t
flwrMod_t <- glm(flowering ~ log_LL_t + I(log_LL_t^2), data = dat, family = binomial)
summary(flwrMod_t)
## plot model results 
plot(flowering ~ log_LL_t, data = dat)
newdata <- data.frame("log_LL_t" = seq(from = min(dat$log_LL_t, na.rm = TRUE),

abline(v = recMod$coefficients, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

### Probability of a seedling in year *t* establishing to a rosette in year *t+1*
$$p_{estab}$$
```{r message=FALSE}
## make a column in 'dat' that labels 'recruits' to the rosette stage
dat$recruit <- 0
dat[dat$age==0 & is.na(dat$age)==FALSE,"recruit"] <- 1
## get the number of recruits/year 
estabTemp <- dat %>%

  mutate(Year = (as.numeric(Year) + 2000))

## combine seedling and rosette recruit data
estabs <- left_join(estabTemp, seedlings)

## increase the number of seedlings by 10% (to conservatively account for missed seedlings or ones that germinated later in the year)
#estabs$Seedlings_t <- round(1.10 * estabs$Seedlings_t,0)
## calculate the probability of seedling in year t establishing to a rosette in year t+1
estabs$P_estab <- estabs$recruits_tplus1/estabs$Seedlings_t

estabs[is.infinite(estabs$P_estab),"P_estab"] <- NA
## if the value is >1, round back to one (must have missed some seedlings)

estabs <- as.data.frame(estabs)
p.estab.est <- sum(estabs$P_estab, na.rm = TRUE)/sum(is.na(estabs$P_estab)==FALSE)
```

### Probability of a seed produced by an adult plant in year t will enter the seedbank
$$\delta$$

```{r}

### Probability that a seed in the seedbank in year t will survive and be in the seedbank in year t+1 
$$s_b$$
```{r}

```


## Implement the IPM 
use ipmr to fit the IPM
```{r}
library(ipmr)

# Set up the initial population conditions and parameters (example w/ only one discrete stage and dummy seedbank rates)
data_list <- list(
  g_int     = coef(sizeMod)[1],
  g_slope   = coef(sizeMod)[2],
  g_sd      = summary(sizeMod)$sigma,
  s_int     = coef(survMod)[1],
  s_slope   = coef(survMod)[2],
  p_b_int   = coef(flwrMod_t)[1], #probability of flowering
  p_b_slope = coef(flwrMod_t)[2],
  p_b_slope_2 = coef(flwrMod_t)[3],
  b_int   = coef(seedMod_t)[1], #seed production
  b_slope = coef(seedMod_t)[2],
  c_o_mu    = coef(recMod), #recruit size distribution
  c_o_sd    = summary(recMod)$sigma,
  p_r   = p.r.est, # Probability that non-seedbank seeds will germinate into seedlings in year t+1
  gamma = gamma.est, # Probability that a seed in the seedbank in year t will exit the seedbank in year t+1

  p_estab = p.estab.est # probability that a seedling will establish into a rosette in t+1
)

## Next, we set up two functions to pass into the model. These perform the inverse logit transformations for the probability of flowering model (r_r/𝑟𝑟(𝑧)).

# We'll set up some helper functions. The survival function
# in this model is a quadratic function, so we use an additional inverse logit function
# that can handle the quadratic term.

inv_logit <- function(int, slope, sv) {
  1/(1 + exp(-(int + slope * sv)))
}

inv_logit_2 <- function(int, slope, slope_2, sv) {
  1/(1 + exp(-(int + slope * sv + slope_2 * sv ^ 2)))
}

## We’ve now defined all of the kernels, next are the implementation details. These also differ somewhat from simple IPMs. The key difference in the implementation arguments list lies in the state_start and state_end of each kernel, and is related to the family argument of each kernel. Kernels that begin with one state and end in a different state (e.g. moving from seed bank to a plant) will have different entries in the state_start and state_end slots. It is very important to get these correct, as ipmr uses this information to generate the model iteration procedure automatically (i.e. code corresponding to Equations 1-2).
